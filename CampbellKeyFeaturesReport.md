### Key Feature Assessment for Guitar Lesson Product

**Report prepared by:** Alasdair Campbell

#### Key Feature: Readily available content and videos

##### Description: 
The major online guitar lesson companies all offer videos and content on their website to allow users to learn at their own pace, at any time and in whatever style they learn best. Additionally, online and downloadable videos can be interacted with for example allowing users to rewind so they can try a certain section multiple times until they perfect the technique. Ultimately, this feature forms the main content of the website and is designed to increase user engagement with the site while also keeping users interacting with content for a longer period of time.

##### Why is this feature a key feature? 
This feature is a key feature because it provides the core learning content of the website in an easily consumable manner that will keep users engaged with the website for a lengthy amount of time. Online videos and other content are a critical feature of a guitar lesson website as they are a flexible, inclusive and captivating learning tool that will be one of the main draws to use this guitar lesson site.

##### What sources led you to your selection of this feature?
Deviant Noise Review (https://deviantnoise.com/guitar/online-lessons/), Guitar Tricks (https://www.guitartricks.com/), FenderPlay (https://try.fender.com/play), TrueFire (https://truefire.com/). For all three of these guitar sites the homepages specify that the video library is large, easy to access and downloadable. The deviant noise review also contains further details about what exact content is downloadable and how content and videos are accessed through the site.

##### Characteristics of Definition 1.1
There would be no product without this feature because a user of the guitar lesson site needs to be able to learn how to play the guitar and this is the most frequently use and most suitable method of content delivery.
The absence of this feature would also significantly degrade its usefulness as most people learn the guitar in their spare time, which requires learning the guitar to be a flexible activity, which requires a large video and content library.
The feature is a top-level feature because in order to interact and use the website, the company needs to provide some learning subject matter so lots of other features require this feature to be present.
The feature does not give a significant competitive advantage over competitors, as most of the competitors contain an extensive video library so there is no real advantage to be gained here, however having a larger library then any competitors would still be advantageous.
In conclusion, online content and videos are a key feature because they contain enough characteristics of a key feature.

#### Key Feature: Several learning paths

##### Description: 
This feature allows an actor to follow a multitude of different paths while they are learning by letting the user change various components of their current path or by letting a user select a curated lesson plan to follow along with. The learning paths can be personalized for an individual or be a broad path aimed at appealing to thousands by they are an important tool in increasing user satisfaction with the product by providing them necessary guidance through the learning process. 

##### Why is this feature a key feature? 
Having a wide variety of learning paths and options is a key feature of a guitar lesson site because they can be tailored to appeal to different user abilities, preferences and free time. This feature improves the usefulness of the product and increases the engagement with the website as a user is more likely to successfully learn to play the guitar with several different learning features and therefore the user is more likely to continue with their subscription and recommend the site to other potential customers.

##### What sources led you to your selection of this feature?
Deviant Noise Review (https://deviantnoise.com/guitar/online-lessons/), Guitar Tricks (https://www.guitartricks.com/), FenderPlay (https://try.fender.com/play), TrueFire (https://truefire.com/). These three guitar sites all emphasize some form of learning path on their homepage, be it beginner courses designed by the company or personalized learning routes that change depending on the user. Additionally, the deviant noise review mentions the learning path options for all three websites.

##### Characteristics of Definition 1.1
There could be a product without this feature because a user could still interact with online videos or interactive lessons, however the product would be vastly inferior without providing users any guidance
Therefore, the absence of this feature would significantly degrade the websites usefulness as people would have a far harder time trying to understand and process the learning material.
This feature is a top level feature because the average user's experience is completely curated by a learning path that contains a collection of important features including essential items like videos and chord charts.
This feature could also provide a significant competitive advantage over competing products because paths that are constructed in a way that provides a more complete and engaging user experience will drive revenue by drawing in more customers.
In conclusion, having several different learning paths is a key feature because it contains enough of the essential characteristics.

#### Key Feature: Song genre and content variety

##### Description: 
Having a wide variety and diverse selection of song genre, design and flow, and other content is a key feature for any guitar lesson website. This feature provides a site user with a choice for the direction and environment they conduct their learning and provides the website with many hours more content by keeping a user engaged with learning more and different content.

##### Why is this feature a key feature? 
This is a key feature because it allows users to apply their skills to an array of different content, often with opposite tones and structures, and lets consumers experiment and challenge themselves more. This feature is also key to maintaining user engagement with the product by providing them with popular songs to strive to learn and always providing a user with a new challenge through its diverse selection of content.

##### What sources led you to your selection of this feature?
Deviant Noise Review (https://deviantnoise.com/guitar/online-lessons/), Guitar Tricks (https://www.guitartricks.com/), FenderPlay (https://try.fender.com/play), TrueFire (https://truefire.com/). The deviant noise review has a comparison for all of these websites song variety and while some sites were better than others, all three of these companies possess a large catalog of music for a user to consume. Furthermore, library content is one of the major selling points for these websites, so all of the companies boast about the size of their content on their respective homepages.

##### Characteristics of Definition 1.1
There could still be a product without this feature as users would not want to use a website that does not have a good selection of music for them to learn, however it would be a very threadbare website without this variety and many consumers would use competitors products instead.
It is certain the absence of this feature would diminish the usefulness of the website as users require both an abundant amount of content but also a very diverse set of songs and if this was not present, the product would not be as useful as it could be and users would seek out other options.
The feature is not necessarily a top-level feature because a comprehensive video library would feature a diverse selection of songs to choose from, or a learning path requires a wide array of songs to use. However, possessing a diverse selection of songs is still a high-level feature important for the site to function properly.
The feature does not automatically give a significant competitive advantage over competitors, as most of the competitor products also have a large and diverse range of music, however it is definitely possible to have an advantage over a competitor by having music in a genre they do not own any music for.
In conclusion, having a myriad of song genre, style and content is a key feature because it contains enough characteristics of a key feature.

#### Final assessment
I believe these are the key features because they contain most if not all of the characteristics of a key feature and are features that are present in most of the research sources. These are the most important key features because they increase the useability and value of the guitar lesson website and the function and appeal of the website would be greatly reduced were these features not present. However, these were not the only possible key features and I did explore two other potential key features: a Free Trial and Progress Saving and Tracking. A free trial was a feature that all of the companies had, including LessonWithYou which I didn't use as a source earlier because it is a fundamentally different approach to guitar lesson learning and so had little overlap with the features of the other websites, and also is an important feature of attracting new customers to the product. However, I decided a free trial was not a key feature because it did not give an advantage to the company as every other company has one, is not a top level feature because it is just a component of a consumer buying the product and it is not absolutely essential for the product to work. I also decided progress saving and tracking was not a key feature because while it similarly was a present feature in most of the companies and is an important quality of life feature to keep users satisfied and engaged with the product, progress tracking ultimately does not give any real competitive advantage as it is a less important feature, is not a top-level feature as it most likely is used as a tool in a learning path or environment and the product would still exist without it as content could still be used without being tracked.
